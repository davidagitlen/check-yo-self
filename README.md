# Check Yo'Self! 

## Summary 

Check Yo'self is the fourth, and final, project of Module One at the Turing School of Software and Design. The learning goals for the project were as follows: 

+ Solidify and demonstrate your use of:

  * semantic HTML
 
  * clean & organized CSS styles
 
  * DRY JavaScript
 
  * localStorage to persist data
 
+ Iterate through/filter dom elements using for loops/array prototype methods
+ Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
+ Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX

## Spec

Check Yo'self allows the user to create custom lists with titles and inventories of individual checkable tasks by using the input fields on the left side of the page. The lists themselves are displayed in an initially blank section on the right, and populate in a "masonry layout" styleâ€”columns of lists with staggered bottom borders, depending on their lengths.
